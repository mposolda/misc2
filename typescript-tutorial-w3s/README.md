## Intro

This is based on the w3c schools tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_getstarted.php . So if this does not work, it is maybe needed to do some steps
described in the "Getting started" page or on some previous pages in that tutorial.

## How to run

Go to this directory and run:
```
npx tsc
```

This will build the stuff in the `src/my.ts` file into `build/my.js` file. So it is not intended to do directly any changes in the file `build/my.js`! 

Then see this page in the browser (open the devtools console in the browser like FF to see output written in the console): file:///home/mposolda/IdeaProjects/misc2/typescript-tutorial-w3s/index.html
