The `my-app` was generated by following the steps in the next.js tutorial https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation (Very first step).
When running `npm run dev` in the directory `my-app`, it will start the server on `http://localhost:3000` with entry-point corresponding to `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files
as described in the tutorial above. 

Then the next steps was to use applications/examples from https://react.dev/learn quickstart (including tic-tac-toe etc).
